# GraphQueries

Project: Restaurant API with Node.js, GraphQL, Express

Developed and deployed a RESTful GraphQL API for a restaurant management system using Node.js, Express, and GraphQL.
Implemented custom GraphQL queries and mutations for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting restaurant data.
Built schema for restaurant and dish types, allowing dynamic queries for complex data relationships.
Integrated GraphiQL UI for testing API functionality

This setup involves using Node.js to create a server and GraphQL as the query language for the API. You can describe this as building a GraphQL API with Node.js
